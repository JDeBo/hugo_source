Music has been a big part of my life since I picked up my first pair of drumsticks in fourth grade. In high school at Normal Community West I was introduced to marching band, and to this day I continue my work with that same program as an instructor for their drumline. In college my musical studies continued, taking me to [Cuba](/posts/music/cuba/) with the Millikin percussion studio to study Afro-Cuban music, to [Australia](/posts/music/australia/) with my former high school to perform at the Sidney Opera House, and back to Cuba to perform with the Millikin Latin Jazz Project at the Havana International Jazz Festival.

Since college, my musical experiences have slowed down a little, but I still perform as often as possible, whether as a soloist, as the auxiliary percussionist in BandTM, and in community bands throughout Central IL. I'm also trying my hand as an educator, working with the Normal Marching Band drumline and doing individual and group lessons.
