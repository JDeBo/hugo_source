In 2015 I got my first opportunity to visit Havana Cuba with the Millikin Percussion Studio. While we were there we spent a week studying Cuban folkloric and popular music with some of the most renowned teachers in the country. After returning from that trip and joining Millikin's Latin Jazz project, I got to record an album inspired by the Afro-Cuban rhythms and songs we learned while we were there. [Balance Issues](https://open.spotify.com/album/0a7FD5RbyYVNOuAOfilH6R) combined elements of rhumba, salsa and comparsa music with jazz and funk to make a series of songs that are both fun to dance to and exciting to perform!

We submitted the recordings from that album as our application for the [Havana International Jazz Festival](http://festivaljazzplaza.com/en/the-millikin-university-latin-jazz-project/) and were accepted to perform alongside other artists such as the group Snarky Puppy and grammy award winner Christian McBride.
