A little bit about me...

I'm an experienced software developer with a love of music. Many years ago I began studying music as a possible career path. Through that pursuit I learned  the value of criticism, developed a sense of creativity and got comfortable performing under pressure. Now I try to apply those same skills in the business world - whether it's setting my ego aside during code reviews, solving architecture challenges infrastructure analysts or making technical topics digestible in executive briefings.
